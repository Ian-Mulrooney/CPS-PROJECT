    <br> <br>
    <p> I graduated highschool in the Spring of 2023. I graduated from Brooklyn Prospect Charter School, in Brooklyn, New York. I have had a few jobs and internships throughout my life. I umpire games for my local recreational baseball league. I find this to be a fairly fun task. I also interned at T.E.A.L.. This was an organization that supports women with ovarian cancer. I found this to be a very cause. I worked there in early 2023. </p>
